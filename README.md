# CompressingWebPages
Given a dataset of web pages, the program permutate them in order to cluster similar pages together.  In this way, using a compressor algorithm (like LZMA2) we can achieve a better compression size.

In order to use the program, extract the content of the *Input.7z* inside the working directory *(1K or 10K)*
since the the program takes as input the file *Input.warc*.

see [Report.pdf](./Report.pdf) for more deteils.
